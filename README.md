- MySQL database integration
- Docker Compose for building and deployment
- Hosted on Digital Ocean

## Technologies Used
- Spring Boot: Application framework
- Spring Security: For authentication and authorization
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For securing API endpoints
- MySQL: Database for storing user and chat information
- Cloudflare Images: For storing and serving profile images
- Docker Compose: For containerizing and deploying the application

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MySQL

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Flanderzz/TeamSphere-API.git
    cd TeamSphere-API/YipYapTimeAPI
    ```

2. Build the application using Maven:
    ```shell
    mvn clean install
    ```
### Configuration
1. Generate RSA Token in resource folder

### Create key pair
Keys smaller than 2048 bits are considered unsecure
```bash
openssl genrsa -out keypair.pem {your size here}
```

### Extract public key
```bash
openssl rsa -in keypair.pem -pubout -out public.pem
```

### Extract private key
```bash
openssl pkcs8 -in keypair.pem -topk8 -nocrypt -inform PEM -outform PEM -out private.pem
```

2. Update `application-local.yml` with your own values for the cloudflare section here is a link on how to get started with [cloudflare images.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/get-started/)
```yaml
  jwt:
    public:
      key: classpath:public.key
    private:
      key: classpath:private.key
    audience: "your audience here"
    cloudflare:
      api:
        accountID: get-this-from-cloudflare
        key: get-this-from-cloudflare
    server:
      port: 5454
    spring:
      datasource:
        driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
        url: jdbc:mysql://local:3306/teamsphere_db
        password: my-secret-pw
        username: root
      jpa:
        database: mysql
        hibernate:
          ddl-auto: update
        show-sql: true
      rabbitmq:
        host: localhost
        password: guest
        port: 61613
        requested-heartbeat: 580
        username: guest
      servlet:
        multipart:
          max-file-size: 20MB
          max-request-size: 20MB
```

### Docker compose
  This is for the main service without the grafanan loki and promtail
```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
      mysql:
        image: mysql:latest
        environment:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: my-secret-pw
          MYSQL_DATABASE: teamsphere_db
        ports:
          - "3306:3306"
      rabbitmq:
        image: rabbitmq:management
        environment:
          RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: guest
          RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: guest
        command: >
          bash -c "rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_stomp && rabbitmq-server"
        ports:
          - "61613:61613"
          - "15672:15672"
```
